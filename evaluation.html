      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          While cobots, offer numerous advantages in various applications, they
          also come with certain limitations:
        </p>
        <ol class="line">
          <li>
            <b>Dependency on Human Supervision</b>
            <p>
              Although cobots can operate continuously in theory, they still
              require human intervention or oversight. For instance, when the
              factory is vacant at night, the cobot may still need supervision.
              In contrast, industrial robots can function at full throttle
              without human presence
              <a href="works-cited.html#ref1">[1]</a>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Payload Restrictions</b>
            <p>
              Cobots are generally designed for light-duty tasks. Typically,
              they handle payloads ranging from 3 to 10 kg, with some models
              capable of managing up to 35 kg
              <a href="works-cited.html#ref1">[1]</a>. In contrast, certain
              six-axis robots can manage up to 2 tons depending on the
              application. It's important to note that cobots are not suitable
              for heavy-duty tasks. Therefore, for higher loads, cobots might
              not be the best choice.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Safety Approval Challenges</b>
            <p>
              Securing safety approval for cobots can be a complex process.
              There are numerous safety regulations to consider, and
              modifications in the cobot's tasks or tools might necessitate
              renewed certifications. For example, in the European Union, cobots
              must be accredited by a notifying body as part of the CE-marking
              process, ensuring compliance with EU standards
              <a href="works-cited.html#ref2">[2]</a>. Changes can alter the
              cobot's initial purpose which could demand a new safety
              certification, leading to additional expenses and delays.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Speed Constraints</b>
            <p>
              Safety is paramount for cobots, and this often comes at the
              expense of speed. Most cobots move at an average speed of 250
              millimeters per second, which is four times slower than
              traditional industrial robots
              <a href="works-cited.html#ref1">[1]</a>. When human users engage
              with cobots, their speed drops further to ensure safety, leading
              to longer cycle times. Consequently, high-speed applications are
              not ideal for cobots.

    <h2 class="market">Market Trends and Technical Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The industrial landscape of robotics has been dominated by sectors like
      automotive and electronics, which jointly make up over 60% of all new
      global installations. According to a 2022 survey by the International
      Federation of Robotics (IFR) <a href="works-cited.html#ref8">[8]</a>, China
      emerges as the leading cobot producer, boasting 52 cobot models, which is
      equivalent to 26.4% of the global tally. Following China are South Korea
      with a 14.7% share and Japan at 11.2%
      <a href="works-cited.html#ref8">[8]</a>. The remaining global distribution
      is bifurcated between countries like the USA, Germany, Switzerland, and
      Denmark that hold 29.5% share in combination. Nations including Italy, the
      UK, France, Canada, and India hold up to 17.5% of market share
      <a href="works-cited.html#ref8">[8]</a>. Despite extensive literature on
      cobot applications, there's a pressing need to delve into the latest
      advances. Taesi et al offer insights into recent developments,
      categorizing applications and human interactions, and emphasizing
      practical implications.
    </p>

    <h3 class="market-sub">Structural design Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Cobots can be categorized based on their structural design and the number
      of degrees of freedom (DoF), which varies from one to fourteen. Higher DoF
      enhances pose versatility. The primary classification based on DoF are
      Anthropomorphic, Cartesian, SCARA, and Torso. Anthropomorphic cobots,
      which form 90% of the market, consist of a serially connected mechanical
      structure with at least four joints. Torso cobots mimic human movements,
      boasting high versatility with twisting, bending, and rotating
      capabilities. Cartesian cobots are grounded on an orthogonal Cartesian
      system, while SCARA cobots feature two horizontally mobile arms ending in
      a prismatic coupling for vertical movements.
    </p>

    <h3 class="market-sub">Accuracy</h3>
    <div class="market-flex-container">
      <p>
        Accuracy indicates the divergence between the targeted and achieved
        poses. Over 90% of anthropomorphic cobots demonstrate a precision
        between 0.01 mm and 0.20 mm, with payload capacities ranging from 0.3 kg
        to 20.0 kg. On the other hand, Cartesian, Torso, and SCARA cobots
        primarily handle payloads between 0.5-5.0 kg, maintaining an accuracy
        below 0.10 mm <a href="works-cited.html#ref8">[8]</a>, as shown in Figure
        1.
      </p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="market-sub">Energy consumption and TCP velocity</h3>
    <div class="market-flex-container">
      <p>
        On analyzing the relation between energy consumption and Tool Center
        Point (TCP) velocity, it was found that the latter, representing the
        end-effector's operational speed, directly influences workstation cycle
        times and worker safety. As payload increases, power consumption also
        increases, as shown in Figure 2. Cobots handling payloads over 10 kg
        consume more than 0.50 kW power. It's noteworthy that a TCP speed hike
        from 1 m/s to 3 m/s does not majorly impact energy consumption
        <a href="works-cited.html#ref8">[8]</a>. The chief determinant for power
        needs is the payload capacity, especially in the range of one kilogram
        to six kilograms, considering the gripper's combined mass and inertia
        with the manipulated item.
