          Collaborative robots, commonly referred to as Cobots, are a unique
          segment of robotic automation primarily designed for safety. Unlike
          their industrial robot counterparts, they boast rounded edges, force
          limitations, and lightweight designs
          <a href="works-cited.html#ref3">[3]</a>. These robots use an array of
          sensors that help them avoid collisions with humans. In the event of
          unexpected contact, safety protocols ensure that the cobots are
          promptly shut down.
        </p>
        <p>
          These robots are not just built for safety but are also developed to
          operate seamlessly alongside human workers within a shared workspace.
          This is due to advancements in touch technology, artificial
          intelligence, mobile technology, computer vision, and cognitive
          computing. These innovations enable these relatively small and less
          power-intensive robots to be fully aware of their environment. They
          can safely perform various tasks close to humans and can also rapidly
          acquire new tasks through techniques like demonstration and
          reinforcement learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, the division of labor sees cobots handling repetitive and
          mundane tasks, leaving more intricate and mentally demanding jobs to
          their human counterparts. Such an arrangement is beneficial for both.
          While the cobot ensures accuracy, uptime, and repeatability, the human
          worker offers intelligence and superior problem-solving capabilities
          <a href="works-cited.html#ref3">[3]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The realm of possible applications for these cobots is vast, ranging
          from manufacturing-related functions like assembly line support,
          packaging automation, and product quality control to sectors like
          healthcare and education. As industries begin to recognize the
          economic advantages of integrating cobots, the market for them is
          poised for substantial growth. This growth is further propelled by the
          current shortage of skilled labor and the escalating costs associated
          with human workers <a href="works-cited.html#ref3">[3]</a>.

          Designing cobots involves creating a collaboration between robots and
          humans. This gives the cobots an understanding of their environment
          and equips them with actions that achieve a collaborative goal.
          Zaatari et al (2019) state the main components of a cobot design:
        </p>
        <ol class="line">
          <li>
            <b>Learning</b>: Cobots learn skills in a manner akin to humans,
            utilizing trial and error, observation, feedback, and posing
            questions <a href="works-cited.html#ref4">[4]</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Offline</b>: The programmer designs the learning algorithm
                and offers initial data, which could be demonstrations or
                training sets, for the cobot to learn from.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Online</b>: The operator can directly influence the cobot's
                learning by providing feedback, personalized demonstrations, or
                answers to the robot's queries. Additionally, the operator can
                indirectly affect the cobot's learning by being a part of its
                observed environment.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Communication</b>: Communication can be both verbal (speech) or
            non-verbal, including gestures as shown in Figure 1, gaze, haptics,
            head pose, and user interfaces
            <a href="works-cited.html#ref4">[4]</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Offline</b>: The programmer sets up and defines potential
                cobot actions and the fundamental motion control. This is
                referred to as the Traditional role.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Online</b>: The operator explicitly communicates with the
                cobot in real-time, directing it towards predefined actions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Optimization</b>: The optimization aims to minimize factors like
            operator workload, energy consumption, and time, while maximizing
            elements like comfort, trust, and product quality. This method often
            results in better performance compared to human-only operation
            <a href="works-cited.html#ref4">[4]</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Offline</b>: The programmer crafts cost functions and
                optimization algorithms. They model essential aspects of the
                cobot's environment, like obstacles and tool positions, based on
                the robot's actions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Online</b>: During operation, the cobot's performance is
                implicitly influenced by the operator, who becomes part of its
                cost function.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In contrast to traditional industrial robot programming, where a robot
          functions deterministically and without human-awareness, Human-Robot
          Collaboration (HRC) introduces unpredictability due to human
          involvement. This dynamic requires cobots to adapt and respond in
          real-time, making the above features critical for effective
          collaboration.
