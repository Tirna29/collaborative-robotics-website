    <h2 class="format-h2">Manufacturing</h2>

    <p>
      The contemporary manufacturing landscape is characterized by intricate
      electro-mechanical systems, making today's production plants complex. This
      complexity is not just inherent but also grows across the system's life
      cycle phases, such as design, development, and operation. In response to
      this, advancements in sensing technologies, virtualization, and computing
      power have given rise to the concept of digital twins. A digital twin (DT)
      is a real-time digital representation of a physical system that
      facilitates testing and validation <a href="works-cited.html#ref5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the potential of DTs to manage system complexity across various
      scientific domains, there has been a significant push to harness them in
      addressing the manufacturing challenges created by the need for
      decentralized and customization production controls. To meet these
      challenges, there is a growing emphasis on the interplay between humans
      and machines, with human-robot collaboration (HRC) using cobots emerging
      as a pivotal aspect. HRC seeks to blend the unique strengths of humans and
      robots—like dexterity, intelligence, and sensing—to accomplish tasks such
      as assembly processes <a href="works-cited.html#ref5">[5]</a>. From a
      design viewpoint, HRC embodies a multifaceted biomechatronic structure,
      with design decisions heavily reliant on computer-aided simulation models
      for validation and failure analysis.

          Bilberg et al (2019) delved into the advantages of DTs for HRC,
          emphasizing skills distribution between humans and robots, optimizing
          robot trajectories, workload balancing, and robot program generation,
          especially in variant-oriented production contexts. The system
          consists of four modules as shown in Figure 1.
        </p>
        <ul class="line">
          <li>
            <h3>Task Decomposition Engine</h3>
            <p>
              This module dissects product assembly into various tasks,
              evaluating them based on physical attributes and assembly traits.
              Tasks are scored for their automation suitability, categorizing
              them as manual or robotic.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Assembly Task Library</h3>
            <p>
              Comprising function-blocks representing assembly tasks, it
              connects to an event-based human and robot simulation mirroring
              the actual production system. The simulation, with predefined key
              positions, generates operational plans and estimated cycle times,
              facilitating efficient robot program development.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Decision Engine</h3>
            <p>
              Receiving simulation data, this module allocates resources for
              balanced production scheduling and crafts a control program.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Control Interface</h3>
            <p>
              This module executes the robot program and communicates task
              instructions to the operator via an interactive display.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By leveraging the power of digital twins in human-robot collaboration,
          modern manufacturing can address its complexities and drive
          productivity to new heights.

          As the global population ages, a spike in life expectancy brings forth
          three prominent challenges: a surge in the elderly demographic,
          escalating cognitive and physical challenges among them, and a rise in
          single-person households. There is an escalating need for effective
          elderly care solutions, such as healthcare service robots and
          assistive technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ribeiro et al (2021) introduced CHARMIE (Collaborative Healthcare/Home
          Assistant Robot by Minho Industrial Electronics)
          <a href="works-cited.html#ref6">[6]</a>. This anthropomorphic robot, as
          shown in Figure 2, is tailored for both healthcare and domestic
          environments. Unlike other robots, CHARMIE is unique in its machine
          learning capabilities, allowing it to learn and refine tasks via
          direct interaction and observation. CHARMIE boasts a suite of
          functionalities: dynamic obstacle detection, safe navigation,
          human-robot interaction systems, and domestic object manipulation
          <a href="works-cited.html#ref6">[6]</a>. The robot handles tasks in
          nursing homes, homes, and healthcare facilities, ranging from fall
          detection to setting up tables. CHARMIE’s design promises a future
          where the elderly can lead more independent, healthier lives. Examples
          of its adaptability include delivering food trays in hospitals,
          transporting medicine in healthcare facilities, and assisting in
          household chores <a href="works-cited.html#ref6">[6]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Its versatility is showcased through tasks like:</p>

        <ul class="space-items">
          <li>Goods transportation and pick and place tasks.</li>
          <li>
            Following and communication with users through speech and visual
            cues.
          </li>
          <li>Navigating and recognizing objects in its environment.</li>
          <li>
            Assisting users in tasks they might find challenging on their own.

          Higher education institutions are increasingly incorporating active
          learning with elements of group discussion. The goal is to foster
          problem identification and resolution skills, preparing students for
          the global workforce. Traditional education modes are evolving, where
          learners initially use an e-Learning platform like MOOC for content
          comprehension and subsequently engage in classroom group discussions
          to apply their knowledge. This e-Learning paradigm is also witnessing
          the integration of cobots to enhance the learning experience. The
          development of social, autonomous robots capable of human-like
          interactions including gestures, body language, facial expressions,
          and touch hold promise for the education sector.
        </p>

        <p>
          The study by Tojo et al presents a collaborative e-Learning system
          where the entire learning process occurs in a remote environment,
          accessed by learners via the Internet. The challenge lies in ensuring
          a realistic learning experience and fostering engagement during group
          discussions. A collaborative robot named Interactive Tutor Robot (ITR)
          was introduced to enhance interactions. The primary focus was to
          analyze the impact of the robot's gestures on learners, evaluated
          through experimental observations and semantic differential (SD)
          assessments.
        </p>

        <p>
          The e-Learning environment, as shown in Figure 3, consists of an ITR
          and a notebook computer connected to the Internet. The computer shows
          the e-Learning content, while the ITR facilitates the learning
          process. Individual learning can be distinguished with a single unit
          as 1st-level individual learning and group learning with multiple
          units as 2nd-level group learning
          <a href="works-cited.html#ref7">[7]</a>. The latter is referred to as a
          collaborative e-Learning system for distinction.
        </p>
        <p class="p-before-list">In this model:</p>
        <ul class="space-in-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Interaction</strong> is between the ITR and student, where
            learning support information is exchanged and understanding gauged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication</strong> occurs between multiple ITRs, sharing
            and accumulating learning support data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaborative learning</strong> happens between learners. In
            the 1st-level, it's mostly individual study, while in the 2nd-level,
            learners collaborate, applying knowledge, sharing insights, and
            refining skills. Unlike traditional group learning where learners
            congregate, in our system, they use ITRs as avatars for virtual
            group learning.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="p-before-list">The communication mechanism involves:</p>
    <ul class="space-in-list">
      <li>
        <strong>From ITR to Learner</strong>: Sounds and sound effects, and
        visual gestures facilitated by robot actuators for movement and audio
        functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>From Learner to ITR</strong>: Visual cues like facial
        expressions, voice, and tactile feedback by touching the robot. The ITR
        is equipped with cameras for sight, microphones for sound, and touch
        sensors for tactile feedback.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In conclusion, the fusion of active learning and collaborative robots in
      e-Learning systems offers a promising avenue for enhanced, interactive,
      and globally accessible education.
